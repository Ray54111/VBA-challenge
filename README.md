# VBA-challenge

I created a VBA to pull data to create datapoints for my ticker summary. The summary has a cell for each ticker including the yearly point difference, Percent change and total stock volume for the given year.

The bonus pulls from the new columns to ID the max and min of percentage change and also the highest stock volume.
